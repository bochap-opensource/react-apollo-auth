# react-apollo-auth

[react-apollo-auth] is a proof of concept (POC) for doing authentication for a React and GraphQL without using a 3rd party provider. It was build as part of the article in Medidum.com (https://medium.com/oredi/authentication-with-react-apollo-client-and-graphql-5edce538fb52) All content is completely free and open-source.

## Contributions / Fixes

As the whole project is open-source, you're more than welcome to file issues and create PRs for fixes.

## Installation & Running locally

You can run a local instance of the app by executing the following commands in a terminal:
```sh
git clone git@github.com:seetd-knowledge/react-apollo-auth.git
cd react-apollo-auth
npm install
npm run devServer
```

> Note: This is not a full blown application and it does not represent the most secure or robust authentication system. It is meant to be a concept that can be built upon if the decision is made to make an in-house authentication system. It is opinionated and does not represent the best practice.
